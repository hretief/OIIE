## Endpoint-level tests for the MMS read path

**Status:** not started. Agreed at the end of the 2026-08-14 session, deferred so
the demo could be walked through first.

The 88 tests in `tests/SimHost.Tests` are structural: they assert schema
fidelity and identity semantics. That is the right thing for them to do, and it
is also why they could not catch either bug found on 2026-08-14. Both were in
the read/response path rather than in the registry logic:

1. `CirClient.ResolveAsync` returned an empty equivalence list on a cache hit,
   so `MmsContextResolver` reported a successfully related twin as unrelated.
2. `/admin/mms/locations` resolved the owner correctly, used it to filter, and
   then omitted it from the response.

Neither is reachable from a structural test, so add coverage over
`/admin/mms/locations` for:

- **Scoped:** a twin related to an owner that has inventory returns only that
  owner's rows, with `ownerId` and `ownerName` populated. Metro Traffic
  (`OWNER_ID` 2) and District 6 (`OWNER_ID` 8) are the only seeded owners with
  inventory, at 9 and 4 rows of the 13.
- **Unscoped:** no `twin` parameter returns all 13 rows with a null `ownerId`.
  This is the case that distinguishes a filtered result from an unfiltered one.
- **Unresolved:** a twin with no relation returns zero rows plus a reason, and
  never falls back to returning everything. Filtering failure must not leak one
  district's inventory to another.
- **Cache hit:** resolution stays correct on a second call. This is the specific
  regression from bug 1 above and the one most likely to reappear, since the
  CIRID is cached but the equivalence set deliberately is not.

An owner with no inventory is worth a case too: District 1 (`OWNER_ID` 4) is
related but has zero rows, which must read as resolved-but-empty rather than
unresolved.

## Latency of scoped MMS reads

**Status:** diagnosed, not fixed. Deferred by the user on 2026-08-14 to be
picked up later. Full evidence and ruled-out causes in DR-010.

A scoped `/admin/mms/locations?twin=…` takes ~1.9s to return 9 rows; the same
endpoint unscoped returns 13 rows in ~450ms. The cause is not the MMS table or
its indexing but a single ISBM round trip per scoped read, and within that, the
hardcoded 2s Service Bus receive timeout in
`ISBMProvider/Infrastructure/ServiceBusMessageBroker.cs`:

```csharp
var recv = await receiver.ReceiveMessageAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2), ct);
```

### Where to start

`PeekNextAsync` is the only receive call site in the provider, so the change is
small in size but not in blast radius. The 2s wait is *correct* for genuine
asynchronous consumers — `InboxPump` and `IsbmBodListener` long-poll on purpose,
and shortening it globally turns their efficient blocking reads into a busy spin
against Service Bus, raising cost and throttling risk.

So the shape of the fix is a per-call wait, not a smaller constant:

1. Thread a receive timeout through `PeekNextAsync` (config-backed, defaulting
   to the current 2s so subscriber behaviour is unchanged).
2. Pass a short wait only on the consumer-request read path, which is
   synchronous request/response and has a caller waiting on it.
3. Redeploy `ISBMProvider`. This cannot be validated locally, which is the main
   reason it was not done in the same session as the diagnosis.

Re-measure with the timings above as the baseline: unscoped ~450ms is the floor,
since it does no ISBM round trip at all.

### Do not

Cache the equivalence set to dodge the round trip without reading DR-008 and
DR-010 first. It looks like the obvious shortcut and it reintroduces the bug
where a successfully related twin reads as unrelated — the CIRID is cacheable,
the equivalence set is not, because MMS reads `OWNER_ID` out of it and has
nowhere local to store one.
